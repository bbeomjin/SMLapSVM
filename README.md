# SMLapSVM
Multicategory Laplacian support vector machines

```SMLapSVM``` is an R package. ```SMLapSVM``` provides functions for fitting the reinforced multicategory Laplacian support vector machine (RMLapSVM) and the reinforced angle-based multicategory Laplacian support vector machine (RAMLapSVM).
Furthermore, ```SMLapSVM``` also provides functions to fit the structured RMLapSVM (SRMLapSVM) and the structured RAMLapSVM (SRAMLapSVM).
